         <h3 class="typing-text">I'm a <span>Design Student</span> </h3>
            <p>I'm a second year student at SFSU! I am currently majoring in viscom; i am not a part of any groups or clubs on our campus. 
            In this city it's just me and some of my friends. In our free time we usually just hang out and visit cute cafes/ restaurants (we are all foodies :)). 
            one fun fact about me: I treat banana bread as a cake (did you know subway sandwiches are (legally) considered cakes???). My favorite colors are white, 
            and baby pink/ baby blue. My first ever pet was a turtle that my dad brought as a gift from his work trip. When I was in kindergarten I had 3 love 
            interests that were completely opposite from each other (I don't discriminate). I just turned 20 about a month ago. My zodiac sign is capricorn. 
            Right now my favorite food ingredient is eggs. I still donâ€™t have my drivers licence. I sometimes chug three water bottles in one go and sometimes dont drink at all. 
            I wear extra warm socks, long pants, a sweater and sleep under two blankets all year long. My hands are probably cold right now. </p>
