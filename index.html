         <p>I'm a second year student at SFSU! I am currently majoring in viscom; i am not a part of any groups or clubs on our campus. 
         <br>In this city it's just me and some of my friends. In our free time we usually just hang out and visit cute cafes/ restaurants (we are all foodies :)). 
         <br>one fun fact about me: I treat banana bread as a cake (did you know subway sandwiches are (legally) considered cakes???). My favorite colors are white, 
         <br>and baby pink/ baby blue. My first ever pet was a turtle that my dad brought as a gift from his work trip. When I was in kindergarten I had 3 love 
         <br>interests that were completely opposite from each other (I don't discriminate). I just turned 20 about a month ago. My zodiac sign is capricorn. 
         <br>Right now my favorite food ingredient is eggs. I still donâ€™t have my drivers licence. I sometimes chug three water bottles in one go and sometimes dont drink at all. 
         <br>I wear extra warm socks, long pants, a sweater and sleep under two blankets all year long. My hands are probably cold right now. </p>
