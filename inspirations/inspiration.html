              <p>He is an Australian writer, director, and producer best known for his fast and erratic style. 
                His vision is out of this world; I would rather watch an hour-long movie with no words but the most amazing visuals ever, 
                rather than watch the greatest love story that is poorly executed.</p>

              and romantic drama.” He is one of those designers who dresses all of his models like they are crown princesses.</p>

           <p>Gaylord is a French 2D animator who animates Gods' School: The Olympian Gods. 
            I found this series by accident and was so impressed with the story but upset by the number of episodes (too few). 
            Then, I discovered that Gaylord produces these series <strong>himself</strong>.</p>
